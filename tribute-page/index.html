                  Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (19 May 1881 – 10 November 1938) was a
                  Turkish army officer, revolutionary, and the first President of
                  Turkey. He is credited with being the founder of the Republic of
                  Turkey.

                  His surname, Atatürk (meaning "Father of the Turks"), was granted
                  to him in 1934 and forbidden to any other person by the Turkish
                  parliament.

                  Atatürk was a military officer during World War I. Following the
                  defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I, he led the Turkish
                  National Movement in the Turkish War of Independence. Having
                  established a provisional government in Ankara, he defeated the
                  forces sent by the Allies. His military campaigns led to victory
                  in the Turkish War of Independence.

                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
                  Atatürk then embarked upon a program of political, economic, and
                  cultural reforms, seeking to transform the former Ottoman Empire
                  into a modern and secular nation-state.

                  Under his leadership, thousands of new schools were built, primary
                  education was made free and compulsory, and women were given equal
                  civil and political rights f, while the burden of taxation on
                  peasants was reduced.

                  His government also carried out an extensive policy of
                  Turkification. The principles of Atatürk's reforms, upon which
                  modern Turkey was established, are referred to as Kemalism.
