      <ul>
        <li>Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (19 May 1881 – 10 November 1938) was a
          Turkish army officer, revolutionary, and the first President of
          Turkey. He is credited with being the founder of the Republic of
          Turkey.</li>
        <li>
          His surname, Atatürk (meaning "Father of the Turks"), was granted
          to him in 1934 and forbidden to any other person by the Turkish
          parliament.
        </li>
        <li>
          Atatürk was a military officer during World War I. Following the
          defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I, he led the Turkish
          National Movement in the Turkish War of Independence. Having
          established a provisional government in Ankara, he defeated the
          forces sent by the Allies. His military campaigns led to victory
          in the Turkish War of Independence.
        </li>
        <li>
          Atatürk then embarked upon a program of political, economic, and
          cultural reforms, seeking to transform the former Ottoman Empire
          into a modern and secular nation-state.
        </li>
        <li>
          Under his leadership, thousands of new schools were built, primary
          education was made free and compulsory, and women were given equal
          civil and political rights f, while the burden of taxation on
          peasants was reduced.
        </li>
        <li>
          His government also carried out an extensive policy of
          Turkification. The principles of Atatürk's reforms, upon which
          modern Turkey was established, are referred to as Kemalism.
